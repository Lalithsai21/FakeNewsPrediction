In this project, my aim was to develop a machine learning model capable of categorizing news articles as either real or fake based on their content. After loading and exploring the dataset, I addressed missing values and performed text pre-processing, including stemming and the removal of stopwords. 

The TfidfVectorizer was then used to convert the textual data into numerical feature vectors, and I opted for a logistic regression model for its suitability in binary classification. 

Following the training of the model on a split dataset, accuracy scores were calculated for both the training and testing sets, demonstrating the model's ability to generalize to new data. 

The high accuracy scores indicated the effectiveness of the model. To showcase its practical application, I implemented a predictive system, exemplifying how the model can classify the authenticity of news articles. 

This project serves as a comprehensive illustration of a machine learning pipeline for text classification, addressing the relevant challenge of discerning real from fake news.
